The goal of autoembed is to generate temporal lead or lag embeddings of features 
observed over time. The embeddings can be inputs to downstream models for 
predicting, forecasting, hindcasting, or interpolating.

## Installation

You can install the development version of autoembed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("schafer-research-lab/autoembed")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(autoembed)
## basic example code
```
